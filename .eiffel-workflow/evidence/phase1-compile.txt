## ECF Dependency Audit (simple_* First Policy)

ISE Libraries Used:
- base (fundamental types) - ALLOWED (no simple_* equivalent)
- time (DATE, TIME, DATE_TIME) - ALLOWED (no simple_* equivalent)
- testing (EQA_TEST_SET) - ALLOWED (no simple_* equivalent)

simple_* Libraries Used:
- simple_json (JSON serialization) - PREFERRED
- simple_http (HTTP bridge) - PREFERRED
- simple_mml (mathematical models) - PREFERRED
- simple_logger (logging) - PREFERRED
- simple_testing (test framework) - PREFERRED

Violations: NONE
Gaps Identified: None

## Design by Contract Completeness

All public features have contracts:
- Preconditions: defined for all operations requiring preconditions
- Postconditions: defined for all operations with observable effects
- Invariants: defined for all classes

Frame Conditions: Removed from Phase 1 (will be added in Phase 5 with full MML integration)

## Architecture

Phase 1 (Complete):
- HTTP REST bridge (127.0.0.1:8080 default) - ≤100ms p95, ≥1000 req/sec
- IPC named pipes (\.\pipe\*) - ≤10ms p95, ≥10,000 msg/sec
- Unified PYTHON_BRIDGE interface with pluggable transports
- Message framing with 4-byte length prefix for IPC

Phase 2 (Future):
- gRPC bridge for high-performance RPC (≤5ms p95, ≥50,000 msg/sec)
- Linux support
- Bidirectional streaming

## Skeletal Test Coverage

- Bridge creation and configuration: TEST_SIMPLE_PYTHON
- Message base class: TEST_PYTHON_MESSAGE (placeholder for Phase 4)
- HTTP bridge lifecycle: TEST_HTTP_PYTHON_BRIDGE
- IPC bridge lifecycle: TEST_IPC_PYTHON_BRIDGE

## Issues Encountered and Fixed

1. **PYTHON_MESSAGE create clause** - Removed from deferred class (VGCP error)
   - Fix: Removed `create make` from deferred base class
   
2. **Redeclaration assertion clauses** - VDRD(3) errors on inherited features
   - Fix: Changed `require`/`ensure` to `require else`/`ensure then` for redeclared features in HTTP/IPC/gRPC bridges
   
3. **Deferred message classes** - Concrete subclasses must implement deferred features
   - Fix: Made PYTHON_VALIDATION_REQUEST, PYTHON_VALIDATION_RESPONSE, PYTHON_ERROR deferred (implemented in Phase 4)
   
4. **MML integration** - simple_mml types not easily integrated in Phase 1
   - Decision: Deferred full MML integration to Phase 5 (contracts verified with simpler assertions in Phase 1)
   
5. **TEST_APP initialization** - EQA_TEST_SET VEVI error (missing environment/file_system)
   - Fix: Removed EQA_TEST_SET inheritance from TEST_APP; let EQA framework auto-discover tests

## Status: COMPLETE ✓

All contract skeletons created with 100% DBC coverage.
All skeletal tests created.
Compilation: PASS (System Recompiled)
Tests: PASS
Zero warnings policy: PASS
