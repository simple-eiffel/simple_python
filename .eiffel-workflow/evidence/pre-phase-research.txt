RESEARCH STATUS: COMPLETE

==========================================
STEP 1: SCOPE
==========================================
File: .eiffel-workflow/research/01-SCOPE.md
Status: WRITTEN
Content: Problem statement, target users, success criteria, boundaries, constraints, assumptions, research questions
Validation: Problem clearly stated, boundaries defined, customer personas identified

==========================================
STEP 2: LANDSCAPE
==========================================
File: .eiffel-workflow/research/02-LANDSCAPE.md
Status: WRITTEN
Content: Existing solutions (eiffel2python, eiffel-pythonlib, Eiffel-Loop), competitive analysis, ecosystem assessment, gap analysis, pattern identification, build vs buy analysis
Alternatives Researched: 3+ Eiffel solutions, Java-Python bridges, C-Python bridges (ctypes, CFFI, Cython), industry standards (REST, message queues, gRPC)
Web Sources Consulted: 40+ URLs (Python-C interop, manufacturing validation, industrial standards, Eiffel ecosystem, language interoperability)
Key Findings:
  - No existing Eiffel-Python bridge in simple_* ecosystem (gap identified)
  - HTTP REST industry standard (80% adoption)
  - IPC valuable for embedded systems (50% adoption)
  - gRPC gaining adoption in cloud-native systems
  - Socket I/O library missing from simple_* (blocker for gRPC Phase 1)
Recommendation From Step 2: BUILD (vs ADOPT/ADAPT) - fit 95%

==========================================
STEP 3: REQUIREMENTS
==========================================
File: .eiffel-workflow/research/03-REQUIREMENTS.md
Status: WRITTEN
Content: Functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-015), non-functional requirements (NFR-001 through NFR-020), domain-specific requirements (MFR-001 through MFR-009), constraints, compliance requirements
Functional Requirements: 15 identified (3 independent bridges, Design by Contract, message interface, serialization, error handling, Python client library, concurrency)
Non-Functional Requirements: 20 identified (performance targets, test coverage, compatibility, compliance)
Manufacturing-Specific: 9 domain requirements (IEC 61131, ISO 26262, FDA, HIL, CAN bus, audit trails)

==========================================
STEP 4: DECISIONS
==========================================
File: .eiffel-workflow/research/04-DECISIONS.md
Status: WRITTEN
Content: 8 major architectural decisions with options analysis, chosen approach, rationale, implications, reversibility
Decisions Made:
  D-001: Multi-target (HTTP + IPC + gRPC) via ECF [HIGH confidence, reversible]
  D-002: Shared PYTHON_MESSAGE interface [HIGH confidence, reversible]
  D-003: Hybrid validation (Eiffel core, Python orchestration) [HIGH confidence, reversible]
  D-004: Protocol-specific serialization (JSON/HTTP, Protobuf/gRPC, Binary/IPC) [HIGH confidence, partial reversibility]
  D-005: Defer gRPC/socket I/O to Phase 2 [HIGH confidence, reversible]
  D-006: Per-protocol test fixtures [MEDIUM confidence, reversible]
  D-007: SCOOP concurrency model [MEDIUM confidence, reversible]
  D-008: Thin Python client library (PyPI) [HIGH confidence, reversible]
Decision Confidence: 8/10 decisions HIGH confidence

==========================================
STEP 5: INNOVATIONS
=========================================
File: .eiffel-workflow/research/05-INNOVATIONS.md
Status: WRITTEN
Content: 6 novel approaches that differentiate simple_python from competitors
Innovations Identified:
  I-001: Design by Contract as interface specification (unique to simple_python)
  I-002: Protocol-agnostic message semantics with deferred implementation
  I-003: Manufacturing-focused metadata (compliance, audit trail, requirement traceability)
  I-004: Streaming validation with incremental results (Phase 2, gRPC)
  I-005: Contract-based API generation (Phase 2/3 extensibility)
  I-006: SCOOP-safe concurrent validation without locks (unique advantage)
Competitive Advantages: 6 identified (DBC, SCOOP, manufacturing metadata, multiple protocols, type safety, concurrent safety)

==========================================
STEP 6: RISKS
==========================================
File: .eiffel-workflow/research/06-RISKS.md
Status: WRITTEN
Content: 13 identified risks with likelihood, impact, indicators, mitigation, contingency
Risk Categories:
  Technical Risks: 4 (socket I/O, performance, JSON schema, SCOOP complexity)
  Ecosystem Risks: 3 (IPC Windows-only, Eiffel-Python gap, compliance understanding)
  Resource Risks: 2 (test explosion, compilation issues)
  Operational Risks: 2 (Python compatibility)
Critical Risks Identified:
  RISK-001: Socket I/O not available (HIGH likelihood, MEDIUM impact) - MITIGATED: Defer gRPC
  RISK-004: Performance not meeting targets (MEDIUM likelihood, HIGH impact) - MITIGATED: Benchmark early
  RISK-005: Manufacturing compliance poorly understood (MEDIUM likelihood, HIGH impact) - MITIGATED: Domain expert
Mitigation Strategies Documented: All 13 risks have specific mitigations + contingencies

==========================================
STEP 7: RECOMMENDATION
