# Phase 3 Task Decomposition Evidence
# Project: D:\prod\simple_python
# Date: 2026-01-28

## Task Decomposition Complete

### Files Generated
- .eiffel-workflow/tasks.md (comprehensive task breakdown)

### Task Count
**Total Tasks:** 10
**Status:** All defined with full acceptance criteria

### Task Breakdown

#### Core Implementation Tasks (8 tasks)
1. Message Freeze Mechanism (SCOOP safety)
2. Message Serialization - to_json
3. Message Serialization - to_binary
4. IPC Frame Encoding - encode_frame
5. IPC Frame Decoding - decode_frame
6. HTTP_PYTHON_BRIDGE (initialize, close, send_message, receive_message)
7. IPC_PYTHON_BRIDGE (initialize, close, send_message, receive_message)
8. GRPC_PYTHON_BRIDGE (skeleton, deferred to Phase 2)

#### Support Tasks (2 tasks)
9. Error Handling and Logging (consistency of has_error/last_error_message)
10. Integration and Acceptance Testing Preparation

### Dependencies Identified

**Critical Path:**
Task 1 → Task 3 → Task 7 → Task 9 → Task 10

**Dependency Graph:**
```
Task 1 (Freeze)
  └─> Task 2 (to_json) ─┐
  └─> Task 3 (to_binary) ┤─> Task 6 (HTTP) ─┐
                         ├─> Task 7 (IPC) ──┼─> Task 9 (Error)
                         │                  └─> Task 10 (Integration)
       Task 4 (encode) ─┐
       Task 5 (decode) ─┴─> Task 7 (IPC)
```

### Acceptance Criteria

All 10 tasks have detailed acceptance criteria:
- Phase 4: Implementation checklist (body implementation)
- Phase 5: Testing checklist (skeletal tests fleshed out)
- Phase 6: Adversarial testing checklist

### Implementation Notes

Each task includes:
- Clear algorithm from approach.md
- Specific method signatures from contracts
- Error handling requirements
- Performance targets (where applicable)
- Phase 5 testing expectations

### Dependencies Between Phases

- **Phase 4 (Implementation):** Tasks 1-10 write feature bodies
- **Phase 5 (Verification):** Tests based on these contracts
- **Phase 6 (Hardening):** Stress tests, SCOOP testing
- **Phase 7 (Ship):** Documentation, binaries

### Constraints for Phase 4 Implementer

1. **Contracts FROZEN** - Cannot modify require/ensure/invariant
2. **ZERO WARNINGS** - Any compiler warnings fixed immediately
3. **Preconditions enforced** - to_json/to_binary require is_frozen
4. **Error semantics** - Failure → has_error := true, last_error_message set
5. **Resource cleanup** - No leaks on failed operations

### Human Approval Status

**Awaiting:** User approval to proceed to Phase 4 (Implementation)

## Phase 3 Summary

**Status:** COMPLETE ✓

All contracts from Phase 1 have been decomposed into 10 implementation tasks with:
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Explicit dependencies
- Algorithm specifications from approach.md
- Testing strategy for Phases 5-6
- Constraints for Phase 4 implementer

**Ready for Phase 4:** YES

Tasks are well-scoped (not too large, not too small) and follow the critical path for dependency management.

**Total Estimated Effort (with testing/hardening):** 8-12 developer-weeks

## Files Modified in Phase 3
- .eiffel-workflow/tasks.md (created)
- .eiffel-workflow/evidence/phase3-tasks.txt (created)

## Next Phase

Phase 4 (Implementation):
- Run: `/eiffel.implement d:\prod\simple_python`
- Task: Write feature bodies for Tasks 1-10
- Constraint: Contracts are FROZEN (no modifications allowed)
- Quality Gate: System Recompiled with ZERO WARNINGS
